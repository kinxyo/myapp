A request body is a data that client sends to API
A response body is a data that API sends to client

HTTPS requests methods are used to send client data to API.
(for eg- POST, GET, PUT, PATCH etc.)
POST is similar to GET; the difference lies in the fact that in GET,we don't send any data along with the request. GET is pure request to API server. Hence GET is not secured. In POST, data is sent along with request which can be anything (even an input). POST is secured.
Requests in which we send data are: POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.
